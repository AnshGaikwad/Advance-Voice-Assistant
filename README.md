# Advance-Voice-Assistant
This application is a Simple Voice Assistant for android developers out their to start contributing to open-source, nearly any feature can be implemented as a voice command in this repo. I have used Speech Recognizer for recognizing speech and Text to Speech Engine to convert the text to speech. There is a SQLlite Database to store the previous commands and can be cleared by the clear command. The UI is pretty simple with a Floating Action Button which has a Circular Reveal Activity with it.

# Installation
Run the command in your terminal
```
git clone https://github.com/AnshGaikwad/Advance-Voice-Assistant.git
```
Or you can just clone it through [android studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) which will be much easier.
Note: Always run te application on a real device rather running it on a emulator
